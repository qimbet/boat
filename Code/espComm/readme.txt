The associated two pieces of code are to be installed, one on a pc and one on an esp32. 

The python code queries the esp32 device with the message "request", upon which the esp32 will return some value. 

The machinations of what to return are not included; this is the infrastructure for the wireless communication only.

Update, appended notes:
This hasn't been error-tested lol
It was working at one point in time, but whether that is still the case is a mystery. This was created/edited during a tumultuous time & may need revision
