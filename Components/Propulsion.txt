Add a temperature sensor to motor/battery to warn of overtemps


HOW TO SIZE A MOTOR:
Assume we're aiming for 1.5 m/s (average walking speed)

Drag coefficient for a cylinder is: 0.82
	drag force = 1/2 * dragCoeff * Area * fluidDensity * velocity^2
	ftb drag force = 17.5 newtons

Power (wattage) = velocity * force
		= 1.5 * 17.5

Propeller efficiencies peak near 0.8
	round down to 0.7 in our case lol

>> we need 37.5 Watts coming from our motor
	some flexibility allowed as we're fuzzy on some numbers (drag coefficient, propeller efficiency). Mismatches in wattage will only affect speed.

40mm motor diameter is best for a 4' boat
	- https://www.goodiesrc.com/how-do-you-size-an-rc-boat-motor/
	- We're not a 'boat' per se, since we don't have a hull. We're also not optimizing for speed/efficiency as this point, so we can probably get by with the suggested 40mm (assuming worst-case scenario of pontoonns = inefficient)

Parameters: 
	- No-Load speed:  
		- Speed of motor under a certain voltage, no load

Propeller: Best to buy for first iterations -- imperfections here have large impacts on propulsion efficiency

	- Propellor parameters
		- Pitch: 
			- Angle of propeller blade relative to rotor perpendicular
			- Closely correlated to motor operating range (RPM)
			- Higher Pitch = More thrust per rotation, requires more torque
			- Higher Pitch better for low RPM motors
		- Rake:
			- 'convexity' of propeller
			- Low rake is better for heavier, slower boats
		- Cupping:
			- Propellers can cup at the trail edge of propellers, or distal edge
			- Trail edge cupping: Functional increase to Pitch
			- Distal edge cupping: Functional increase to Rake
		- Blade Count: 
			- Low blade counts (e.g. 1, 2) are more efficient (how?)
			- Higher blade count decreases vibration
			- More blades have higher thrust, less slip
			GENERAL THEMES:
				- Less blades: Racing boats
				- More blades: tow sports, rough water, industrial	
		- Operating RPM:
			- Generally, low RPM is best for larger, high-pitch propellers
			- High RPM fits best with a low-pitch, small propeller
