Motor Mount: 3D Print, custom to motor envelope
Motor: MB-301200-51R14 (rated up to 120VDC, will run at lower)
	- 40mm motor diameter is best for a 4' boat
		- https://www.goodiesrc.com/how-do-you-size-an-rc-boat-motor/
		- We're not a 'boat' per se, since we don't have a hull. We're also not optimizing for speed/efficiency as this point, so we can probably get by with the suggested 40mm (assuming worst-case scenario of pontoonns = inefficient)

Propeller: Best to buy at first -- imperfections here have large impacts on propulsion efficiency

	- Propellor parameters
		- Pitch: 
			- Angle of propeller blade relative to rotor perpendicular
			- Closely correlated to motor operating range (RPM)
			- Higher Pitch = More thrust per rotation, requires more torque
			- Higher Pitch better for low RPM motors
		- Rake:
			- 'convexity' of propeller
			- Low rake is better for heavier, slower boats
		- Cupping:
			- Propellers can cup at the trail edge of propellers, or distal edge
			- Trail edge cupping: Functional increase to Pitch
			- Distal edge cupping: Functional increase to Rake
		- Blade Count: 
			- Low blade counts (e.g. 1, 2) are more efficient (how?)
			- Higher blade count decreases vibration
			- More blades have higher thrust, less slip
			GENERAL THEMES:
				- Less blades: Racing boats
				- More blades: tow sports, rough water, industrial	
		- Operating RPM:
			- Generally, low RPM is best for larger, high-pitch propellers
			- High RPM fits best with a low-pitch, small propeller
