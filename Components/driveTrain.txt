SHAFT SIZE: 4mm

Parts needed: 
 - 90 degree commutator
 - drive shafts
 - shaft couplings
 - superglue

>>> WATERPROOFING / LUBRICANTS

Note: A high percentage of gearbox heat comes from shaft seal friction
	MANY gearboxes need to be vented

For small applications, glue (??) is sufficient as it has comparable strength to the shaft itself (unverified source for average adhesive shear strength: 1000 psi)

Rough up the shaft before gluing to give better adhesion. Degrease & dry. 

DRAWBACK TO ADHESIVE: 
	The glue can push the gear mount offcenter!
	This can be minimized by minimizing the difference between shaft size and gear inner radius, but not so much that the fitting scrapes off all the glue

PRESS FIT:
	Purely a pressure fit -- asssembled under heating of one element
	Tried and true
	Less accurate -- assumptions need to be made

CROSS-DRILLED HOLES:
	A hole is drilled in the driveshaft, and a spoke driven through. This is used as an anchor to turn a gear. 
	Perhaps less suitable in a small-shaft/gear interface

At our scale, Press Fit is (probably) the best target
If too lose; use glue

SHAFT TORQUE: (Upper limit)
	Tension stress in shaft = (Applied torque) * (shaft radius) / (Polar Moment of Inertia)	
	Polar Moment of Inertia ~= 0.0127 m^4
	limit shear stress to < 70MPa for steel bar
	Torque from propeller  = 0.8N (not including bearings friction)
	shaft radius = 0.003 m

Shaft Torque = 0.8    Nm 
Shaft Radius = 0.003  m 
Polar Mom In = 0.0127 m^4
	Tension in shaft: 0.18897
	Well below the upper limit of 70
	3mm shaft safe to use (4mm shaft safer)

MATERIAL NOTES:
	- Grease: a mix of oil + thickener. Solid, but liquid under stress/pressure

	- Watertight sealant: Marine Silicone. Hot glue known to leak.


SEALING METHODS:
	- O-Rings
	- Grease
	- Mechanical 
		- Lots of research being done into this by the Oil/Gas industry
		- Two flat-opposing faces. One rotates with the shaft, one static
		- High precision! 
		- Reduced friction, no measurable leaks
		- Higher demands on cooling. Little room for error. Prone to cascading failure	 
		- Mechanical Seals are made of different materials. 
			- Carbon: Good for clean liquids
			- Silicon Carbide: 9.5 Mohs, can be used among abrasives
			- Ceramic: brittle
			- Aluminum Oxide: 9 Mohs

UNDERWATER MOTOR: 
	- Enclose motor in waterproof container, use marine grease to form a barrier

 - Corrosion (e.g. rust, sand, particulates) increases wear
 - Bearing wear, shaft deflection
	- A misaligned seal is not a seal
 - Pressure differential
