For small applications, glue (??) is sufficient as it has comparable strength to the shaft itself (unverified source for average adhesive shear strength: 1000 psi)

Rough up the shaft before gluing to give better adhesion. Degrease & dry. 

DRAWBACK TO ADHESIVE: 
	The glue can push the gear mount offcenter!
	This can be minimized by minimizing the difference between shaft size and gear inner radius, but not so much that the fitting scrapes off all the glue

PRESS FIT:
	Purely a pressure fit -- asssembled under heating of one element
	Tried and true
	Less accurate -- assumptions need to be made

CROSS-DRILLED HOLES:
	A hole is drilled in the driveshaft, and a spoke driven through. This is used as an anchor to turn a gear. 
	Perhaps less suitable in a small-shaft/gear interface

At our scale, Press Fit is (probably) the best target
If too lose; use glue

SHAFT TORQUE: (Upper limit)
	Tension stress in shaft = (Applied torque) * (shaft radius) / (Polar Moment of Inertia)	
	Polar Moment of Inertia ~= 0.0127 m^4
	limit shear stress to < 70MPa for steel bar
	Torque from propeller  = ???
	shaft radius = 0.003 m

PROPELLER TORQUE: (approx, at normal operation)
	Torque = Power (in Watts) / (angular velocity)
		angular velocity == 2pi/60 * RPM
	We expect an approx Wattage ~= 45W
	Using Torque from sequential calculation; we have an approx RPM of 550
	
	OR

	Torque =  Thrust * Radius 
		Approx radius: 	0.04 m
		Thrust: ~20N

	 	Torque ~= 0.8Nm

Shaft Torque = 0.8    Nm 
Shaft Radius = 0.003  m 
Polar Mom In = 0.0127 m^4
	Tension in shaft: 0.18897
	Well below the upper limit of 70
	3mm shaft safe to use
