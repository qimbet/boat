SIZING: 

600 mm widthspan
	pontoon island edges align at 600mm edges
	Using m6 screws -- 6mm diameter

Base: Plastic (plexiglass? PVC?) sheet: 
	Robust
	
Islands:
	101.6mm squared area
	3D print (arches to fit pontoons)
	

Island bolt sockets: 

	6.5mm diameter
	Radial:
		quarters a circle of r=77mm
			45 degrees from xy axes
		circle center at 50.8mm from edge
	Cartesian: 
		messy lol just don't	


Wire cinching: To fix islands to pontoons
Zip ties: To mount platform to studs 
	Perhaps an intermediary? Bolt platform to 'shoes' which interface more cleanly with studs
Nuts, bolts, washers to mount steering, drivesystem, controls, hardpoints


2nd story (gives a lot more hardpoint room, looks cleaner - DELAY
