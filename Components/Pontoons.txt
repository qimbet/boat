PVC pipe
	As close to 5" diameter as possible
	3'-4' length

	If sinks; fill with lifejacket foam
	
Archimedes' Principle: Flotation is (proportionate to?) the amount of water an object displaces
We can find the expected flotation of an object from its relative density to water

Calculations: 

TAKING: 
Pontoons volume:
	2 pontoons
	5 inch diameter
	4 foot length (48 inches)

	total volume: 
		2 * ( 3.1415 * (2.5)^2 ) * 48
		= 1885 cubic inches 

Pontoons weight (taken from online source):
	21.84 lbs

Weight of 1885 cubic inches water: 
	75 lbs

Pontoons are ~1/3 the weight of comparable water

	

		--> Can calculate draught from this
