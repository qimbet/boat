About Rudders:

Pontoon width = 5" = 127mm
	--> Assume a minimum of  1/2 pontoon submersion during unloaded operation
	--> 63.5mm pontoon submersion
	We want 110 mm of rudder submersion at any time during regular operation
	It is fine for the rudder to extend above the pontoon half-mark
		This gives the vessel stronger steering capacity as its weight increases
		Beneficial as a hedge against inertia

	Rudder bottom should be (110 + 63.55)mm below the top of the pontoons
		173.55mm <-- pontoon top to skeg bottom

	Skeg wing should be (173.55 - 127)mm from top of pontoons
		(RudderBottom - PontoonDiameter)
		46.55mm
		--> round to 50 for ease of use

	Two (separate, equivalent) rules of thumb exist for hobby boats:
		- 5/4 square inches rudder area per foot length of boat
		- Rudder area should be 10% of underwater boat area 
			- For two 4' pontoons with radius 2.5" --> 13sq. inches rudder area
	Long boats are less responsive to steering
	Rudder angle is best to stay within 25-30 degrees

Rudders are most effective directly behind prop wash

Two types of rudders: 
	Non-balanced:
		The axis of rotation is at the edge of the rudder
	Balanced: 
		The axis of rotation is partway through the length of the rudder

	Balanced rudders are more effective:
		More prop wash is caught, making it more efficient. 
		The holding force on the rudder is reduced, making it easier on the servo

Rudder area can build into 'length' or 'depth'. 
	+ Depth is suggested as a better parameter through which to boost area, since it takes less torque to turn. 
	+ Deep rudders contribute to vessel stability. 
	- Deep rudders place more strain on the shaft

Keep the trailing edge as thin as possible
