Mimic control system from RC vehicle. 
Look into what exists 'off the shelf' for RC boats. 

Wireless Communication Protocols
- Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz & 5 GHz bands)
  Range: 30-100m (indoor), up to 300m (outdoor)
  Frequency: 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands
  Data Rate: Up to 1.2 Gbps (802.11ac)
  Pros: Easy to program & implement, cheap
  Cons: Higher power consumption, higher latency

- LoRa/LoRaWAN
  Range: 2-15km (urban), up to 45km (line of sight)
  Frequency: Various (433MHz, 868MHz, 915MHz)
  Data Rate: 0.3-50 Kbps
  Pros: Long range, low power consumption, obstacle penetration
  Cons: Low data-rate, complex programming, bandwidth low for RC

- Radio Frequency (433/915MHz)
  Range: 100m-1km
  Frequency: 433MHz or 915MHz
  Data Rate: 0.5-100 Kbps
  Pros: Cheap? Low power consumption, low latency
  Cons: Low data-rate

Seems like the best fit for control is RF as it can be cheap, reliable and low power, which lets us have longer mission-time.
When we add telemetry we can batch transmissions in short windows to reduce power consumption, but you never want to do this with your control mechanism.

Off-the-shelf assembly: $

RC Receiver: ~$15
RC Controller: $
Logic controller: Microcontroller, inventory
