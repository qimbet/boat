Add a temperature sensor to motor/battery to warn of overtemps


HOW TO SIZE A MOTOR:
Assume we're aiming for 1.5 m/s (average walking speed)

Drag coefficient for a cylinder is: 0.82
	drag force = 1/2 * dragCoeff * Area * fluidDensity * velocity^2
	ftb drag force = 17.5 newtons

Power (wattage) = velocity * force
		= 1.5 * 17.5

Propeller efficiencies peak near 0.8
	round down to 0.7 in our case lol

>> we need 37.5 Watts coming from our motor
	some flexibility allowed as we're fuzzy on some numbers (drag coefficient, propeller efficiency). Mismatches in wattage will only affect speed.

Propeller: Best to buy for first iterations -- imperfections here have large impacts on propulsion efficiency

	- Propellor parameters
		- Pitch: 
			- Angle of propeller blade relative to rotor perpendicular
			- Closely correlated to motor operating range (RPM)
			- Higher Pitch = More thrust per rotation, requires more torque
			- Higher Pitch better for low RPM motors
		- Rake:
			- 'convexity' of propeller
			- Low rake is better for heavier, slower boats
		- Cupping:
			- Propellers can cup at the trail edge of propellers, or distal edge
			- Trail edge cupping: Functional increase to Pitch
			- Distal edge cupping: Functional increase to Rake
		- Blade Count: 
			- Low blade counts (e.g. 1, 2) are more efficient (how?)
			- Higher blade count decreases vibration
			- More blades have higher thrust, less slip
			GENERAL THEMES:
				- Less blades: Racing boats
				- More blades: tow sports, rough water, industrial	
		- Operating RPM:
			- Generally, low RPM is best for larger, high-pitch propellers
			- High RPM fits best with a low-pitch, small propeller

	PROPELLER CALCULATIONS:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Torque = Power (in Watts) / (angular velocity)
	
	angular velocity == 2pi/60 * RPM
	We expect an approx Wattage ~= 45W
	Using Torque from driveTrain.txt, we have an approx RPM of 550
	
	Torque =  Thrust * Radius 
		Approx radius =	0.04m
		Thrust = 17.5N 

	Torque = 45 / (pi/30 * 550) =~ 0.8N
