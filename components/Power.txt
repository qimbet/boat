POWER DEMANDS:
	------------------------------------
	MAIN MOTOR: 12V
	------------------------------------

The motor runs at 12V
Outputting 55W (calculated below), we expect a current draw of roughly 4.5A/hour

Mission time of 2hrs:
	REQUIRED CAPACITY:
	9Ah




DEFINITION: 
	c-rate: Multiplier indicative of the current it takes to discharge a battery over 1 hour
	e.g.	C-rate of 1: 1 hour to fully charge/discharge a battery
		C-rate of 2: 0.5 hours to fully charge/discharge a battery
		C-rate of 0.5: 2 hours to fully charge/discharge a battery
	
LiPo Batteries are hobby standard
Common: 7-12V, 6000mAh, $50 for a 2-pack (wire in parallel?)

DC/DC power converter to step up DC voltage

NOTES:
Car batteries average 12V
	Car batteries are readily available (especially in small-town/remote environments, as we hope to deploy into)
	Lead-Acid batteries (esp. those designed for car ignitions) don't handle deep charge/discharge cycles well
	LA car batteries float in the ~20 lbs range -- not excessive, but kind of heavy
	LA car batteries are not suggested for maritime use, & contain many toxic chemicals
	HOWEVER: offering users the ability to plug into a LA battery in emergency situations is a strong asset for saleability
-----------------------------------------------------

Solid Lead-Acid Batteries:
	PRO:
		Cheap
		Can handle high discharge rates (great for systems that req. sudden bursts of energy)
		Well-understood, established technology
	CON:
		Heavy (not an issue for maritime use tbh)
		limited number of charge cycles, susceptible to degradation
		Environmentally damaging (if not recycled properly)

-----------------------------------------------------

LiFePO battery (lithium lead-phosphate4)
	PRO:
		Best deep-cycle option
		Widely available in marine, solar, RV markets
		Safer than Lithium-ion
	CON:
		Expensive as hell ($550)
		Overpowered: 100-300 Ah
-----------------------------------------------------

SEALED LEAD-ACID (SLA)
	PRO:
		Affordable (~$50)
		Sealed -- leak-proof: safe for environmentally sensitive areas
		Notoriously reliable

POWER ENVELOPES:


SECOND PROJECTION
	Hourly power envelope:
	3.5A @ 12V to motor - 42W
	0.3A @ 12(?)V to comms = 3.5W
	0.7A @ 12V to steering = 8.5W

	SUM: 54w
	Round to 55W @ 12V	
	Drawing 4.5Ah/hour

	------------------------------------

FIRST PROJECTION

	Envelope (hourly): 
	700 mA to steering (servo load)
	300 mA to radio communication
	500 mA buffer power (contingency)
	1500 mA propulsion (2nd battery would route directly to prop --> 4500mA)
		Assuming a current load of 1 amp, DC/DC conversion
		1 battery:   1.5 A = 10.5V
		2 batteries: 4.5 A = 31.5V

NOTE: 
	https://poweringautos.com/how-many-amps-can-a-sla-battery-discharge/
	SLA batteries typicallyl have an effective power delivery of 50-70% of their rated capacity
	Peukert's Law states that SLA batteries have less capacity as rate of discharge increases
		C = I^k * t
		Where:
			C = Capacity at 1 amp; (Ah)
			I = Discharge current (A)
			t = time to discharge (h)
			k = Peukert Constant
		Note: For SLA batteries, k ~= 1.6
		Generally, k increases with time

		Alternatively; 
		t = H * (C / IH)^k
			H = rated discharge time
			C = Rated capacity at discharge rate
			I = Actual discharge current
			k = Peukert constant
			t = actual discharge time

	Note that Peukert's Law does not indicate battery power loss -- only that the power is not available _at the time of use_. Leaving the battery to 'settle' will make the previously inaccessible energy useable. 

	Typically, SLA batteries can handle 20% of their Amp-hour rating as a sustained output current
	Expect 200-300 full-discharge cycles; partial discharges are better for battery life
	Batteries are more efficient in many regards as size scales upwards -- thermal stability, discharge rates, capacity, cycle life

CAUTION: 
	Dischaging SLA batteries below 50% can cause permanent damage; reducing power capacity
	Do not charge batteries too quickly! Thermal stress can damage storage capacity
	Frequent deep discharges are bad for the battery; reducing lifespan
