Any material set for use in seawater should be brass, bronze, A4 stainless steel, titanium, or (possible) aluminum. 

There are other materials (e.g. gold, nickel alloys, etc.) that also perform well in saltwater environemnts, but these are usually associated with budget constraints. 

Titanium is ideal -- strong & corrosion-resistant; but expensive
Anodized aluminum is better than raw aluminum.

Plastics are relatively ocean-safe. Use these when possible.
ABS is water resistant, inert, and is bondable through epoxies.
